Bianconi2012 - EGFR and IGF1R pathway in lung cancer

EGFR and IGF1R pathways play a key role in various human cancers and are
crucial for tumour transformation and survival of malignant cells. High EGFR
and IGF1R expression and activity has been associated with multiple aspects of
cancer progression including tumourigenesis, metastasis, resistance to
chemotherapeutics and other molecularly targeted drugs. Here, the biological
relationship between the proteins involved in EGFR and IGF1R pathways and the
downstream MAPK and PIK3 networks has been modelled to study the time
behaviour of the overall system, and the functional interdependencies among
the receptors, the proteins and kinases involved.

This model is described in the article:

Abstract:

In this paper we propose a Systems Biology approach to understand the
molecular biology of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR, also known as
ErbB1/HER1) and type 1 Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF1R) pathways in non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This approach, combined with Translational
Oncology methodologies, is used to address the experimental evidence of a
close relationship among EGFR and IGF1R protein expression, by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene amplification, by in situ hybridization
(FISH) and the corresponding ability to develop a more aggressive behavior. We
develop a detailed in silico model, based on ordinary differential equations,
of the pathways and study the dynamic implications of receptor alterations on
the time behavior of the MAPK cascade down to ERK, which in turn governs
proliferation and cell migration. In addition, an extensive sensitivity
analysis of the proposed model is carried out and a simplified model is
proposed which allows us to infer a similar relationship among EGFR and IGF1R
activities and disease outcome.
